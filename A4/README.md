# Goals

In this assignment, you will implement two different object detection systems. The goals of this assignment are:

- Learn about a typical object detection pipeline: understand the training data format, modeling, and evaluation.
- Understand how to build two prominent detector designs: one-stage anchor-free detectors, and two-stage anchor-based detectors.
