# Goals

In this assignment, you will implement two different attention-based models, RNN and Transformers. The goals of this assignment are:

- Understand and implement recurrent neural networks
- See how recurrent neural networks can be used for image captioning
- Understand how to augment recurrent neural networks with attention
- Understand and implement different building blocks of the Transformer model
- Use the Transformer model on a toy dataset

Followings are some useful websites which help understanding the transformer machanism,
- [TRANSFORMERS FROM SCRATCH](http://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers)
- [The Annotated Transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html)
- [The Illustrated Transformer](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)
