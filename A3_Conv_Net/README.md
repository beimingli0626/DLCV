# Goals

In this assignment, you will implement Fully-Connected Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification models. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures
- Understand and be able to implement modular backpropagation
- Implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
- Implement Batch Normalization for training deep networks
- Implement Dropout to regularize networks
- Understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and get practice with training these models on data
