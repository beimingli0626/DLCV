# Goals

In this assignment, you will implement various image classification models, based on the SVM / Softmax / Two-layer Neural Network. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Implement and apply a Softmax classifier
- Implement and apply a Two-layer Neural Network classifier
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
- Understand how a Two-layer Neural Network can approximate an arbitrary function
- Practice implementing vectorized gradient code by checking against naive implementations, and using numeric gradient checking
