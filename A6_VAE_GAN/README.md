# Goals

In this assignment you will implement two different kinds of generative models: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

The goals of this assignment are:
- Understand and implement a variational autoencoder and a conditional variational autoencoderand apply them to the MNIST dataset
- Understand and implement a generative adversarial network and apply it to the MNIST dataset
- Use image gradients to synthesize saliency maps, adversarial examples, and perform class visualizations
- Combine content and style losses to perform artistic style transfer
