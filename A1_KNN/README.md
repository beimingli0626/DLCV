# Goals

In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Develop proficiency with PyTorch tensors
- Gain experience using notebooks on Google Colab
- Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
- Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning
- Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
Learn how to test your implementation on Autograder
