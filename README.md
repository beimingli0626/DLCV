# DLCV-EECS498

## Assignment 1
In this assignment, we first learn how to use PyTorch on Google Colab environment. Then practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor, and finally will learn how to use Autograder for evaluating what we implement.

## Assignment 2
In this assignment, we implement various image classification models, based on the SVM / Softmax / Two-layer Neural Network.

## Assignment 3
In this assignment, we implement Fully-Connected Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification models.

## Assignment 4
In this assignment, we implement two different object detection systems, including one-stage anchor-free detectors (FCOS), and two-stage anchor-based detectors (simplified Faster-RCNN).
